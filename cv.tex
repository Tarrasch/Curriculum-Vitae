\section{WORKING EXPERIENCE}
\emph{Facebook}, {\footnotesize Software Engineer Intern, May-August 2013}, Menlo Park, California
\vspace{0.2in}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item I worked on an internal job scheduler and interfaced with HBase. The
     scheduler used reactive programming to handle that HBase region mappings
     can change. I replaced a map reduce job with one using the internal
     scheduler. The internal scheduler were two times as fast.
 \end{itemize}

 \emph{Spotify}, {\footnotesize Software Engineer Intern, June-August 2012 and 2011}, Stockholm, Sweden
\vspace{0.2in}
   \begin{itemize} % \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
   \item In 2011 I designed and implemented a large test suite for their C API
     libspotify which significantly increased the code coverage. Many bugs were
     detected as a result, some of which I fixed. In 2012 I resolved
     concurrency issues their client program had. As a result, they now can use
     continuous integration and trust it, since the bug fixes removed
     intermittent failures.

 \end{itemize}
