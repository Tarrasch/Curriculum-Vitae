\section{WORKING EXPERIENCE}
\emph{Spotify, Software Engineer Intern, June-August 2012 and 2011}, Stockholm, Sweden
\vspace{0.2in}
   \begin{itemize} % \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
   \item In 2011 I designed and implemented a large test suite for their C API
     libspotify which significantly increased the code coverage. Many bugs were
     detected as a result, some of which I fixed. In 2012 I resolved
     concurrency issues their client program had. As a result, they now can use
     continuous integration and trust it, since the bug fixes removed the
     intermittent failures.
