\section{WORKING EXPERIENCE}
\emph{Spotify}, {\footnotesize Developer, April 2014 and ongoing}, Stockholm, Sweden
\vspace{0.2in}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item I help other teams become more data-driven by creating tools and
     providing guidance.
 \end{itemize}

\emph{Facebook}, {\footnotesize Software Engineer Intern, May-August 2013}, Menlo Park, California
\vspace{0.2in}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item I worked on an internal job scheduler and interfaced with HBase. The
     scheduler used reactive programming to handle that HBase region mappings
     can change. I replaced a map reduce job with one using the internal
     scheduler. The internal scheduler were two times as fast.
 \end{itemize}

     team.
